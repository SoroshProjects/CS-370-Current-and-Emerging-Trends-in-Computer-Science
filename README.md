1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
- I was tasked to develop a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. As an AI developer, I was asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The goal of the pirate agent is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent must find a path towards its goal. The initial setup of the AI application, the pirate agent, and the auto-generation of the game were provided for this project. I was responsible for developing the actual use case of this AI, how it learned using Q-learning, and whether the automation and continued education of the AI had actually worked properly within the specified environment it was given.
